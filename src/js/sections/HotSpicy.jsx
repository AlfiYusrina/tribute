      <p className='section-text'>Freddie loved spicy food, not necessarily chilli hot, but a good mix of spice. This was natural if you think back to his birthplace, Zanzibar, the spice island, and his mother would have prepared many traditional Persian dishes for him. He did like traditional ‘home cooking’, as well as the five stars gourmet restaurants. He always used to say at home he wanted mother’s cooking. For deluxe food there were plenty of restaurants to choose from. As his illness progressed so his taste buds suffered and he couldn’t take strong flavours. At that time his personal chef started cooking food with much less spice and made it easy to eat food. A perfect example of that progression was with scrambled eggs. At the start the chef always cooked the Indian variety with chilli and spices, that Freddie remembered from his youth, but by the last year it was served with only a small sprinkling of salt and pepper.</p>
