      <p className='section-text'>After touring Japan with Queen in 1975, Freddie’s favourite place on earth was Japan, its culture and art. He was overwhelmed by the reception Japanese audiences. If Japan is well known for their tasty traditional tasty foods, such as sushi and sashimi. Well, it’s not the first thing what Freddie loves about Japan. Life could be so frantic and Tokyo was always so busy, but he continually found it a place to recharge his batteries. He loves Japanese arts. He had a lovely collection of lacquered boxes, furniture in Japanese motifs, Japanese crockery and porcelains, and Hakata dolls.</p>
      <p>He was acknowledged once as one of  persons who has the largest collections of antique Japanese wood block prints in a private collection in the UK.</p>
