      <p className='section-text'>Some of us live to eat, but Freddie was one of those people who ate to live. He was the master of moving food around the plate to give the appearance of having eaten a good amount. He did enjoy good food, but really didn’t need to consume very much. He loved entertaining guests at meals in the dining room at Garden Lodge and was able to disguise his non-eating by making sure everyone else was ok during the meal. Don’t get us wrong, Freddie always ate enough to keep him going, but his personal assistant said that he can’t remember one time when Freddie leant back in the chair saying ‘I’m stuffed!’</p>
