      <p className='section-text'>Based on his personal assistant, as a rough guide Freddie drinks tea in the morning, the tea was Twinings Earl Grey. He likes tea with sugars and some milk, like other Brits do. In the later afternoon, he drinks champagne or wine and with food. The champagne was usually Louis Roederer Cristal and the white wine was his favourite imported from Switzerland, San Saphorin. Freddie was actually quite knowledgeable about wine and he would know which one he would want with various meals with friends. In the evening, he drinks vodka and tonic. His favourite vodka was Stolichnaya, but in some countries that isnâ€™t available so he would drink Moscovskaya, really the same under a different name. Schweppes was the preferred mixer.</p>
