    <p class="intro">You probably have heard the song “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen. Forty five years ago, that song was written by the Rock God, Freddie Mercury. Thanks to him, this song became a commercial success and became one of the best-selling singles of all time.
      The world will never forget his impact to the rock history. But what else does the world know about him besides his talent and his death-tragedy? As a tribute of his passing, we curate simple things that he loved during his life, little things that
      made his life brighter, like his interest in cats and spicy food?

        <p class="section-text">Or in other words, is <span class="yellow">a cat lover</span>. One of the most important things in the life of Freddie Mercury were his cats. He thought of them as equally important as humans. He had a lot of cats in his life, at a certain point
          he even had 10!

          <p class="section-text spoiled-cats-text">Freddie Mercury just wanted the cats to be happy and have a loving home. It made him feel really good that he could do something like that. He spoiled the cats very much. They didn’t get normal cat food much. Mostly, he prepared some <span class="spoiled-cats-highlight">fresh
            meat</span> for them, like chicken. He also gave them a lot of toys and treats. When it was Christmas, he got them their own <span class="spoiled-cats-highlight">Christmas
          stockings</span> filled with treats and toys and when it was their birthday, they celebrated.
            <br /> When he was on tours, he often <span class="spoiled-cats-highlight">
          made phone calls</span> to his cats. He wanted to hear them and make sure they were alright. Mary would than take the cat on her lap en hold the phone close to their face so they could hear hem well. His fans knew how fond Mercury was of his
            cats, so they often sent stuff for his cats to his fan office. A lot of them also named their cat after Freddie, who was really flattered by those gestures.
            <br /> It was really easy for everybody to see Freddies love for cats. On the inside of the album ‘Classic Queen’, you could see a portrait of Mercury <span class='spoiled-cats-highlight'>wearing a vest</span> with cats on it. If you look
            close, you can see that the cats on the vest are actually his own.

              all of his beloved cats would be taken care of</span>. All of them stayed at Garden Lodge and Mary took care of them. Today, they still live there and Delilah is often spotted on the top of the wall. So it’s clear that she is still the ruler
            of the house and that’s exactly what Freddie would have wanted.

          <p class='section-text'>Some of us live to eat, but Freddie was one of those people who <span class='foods-highlight'>ate to live</span>. He was the master of moving food around the plate to give the appearance of having eaten a good amount. <span class='foods-highlight'>He did
              enjoy good food</span>, but really didn’t need to consume very much. He loved entertaining guests at meals in the dining room at Garden Lodge and was able to disguise his non-eating by making sure everyone else was ok during the meal. Don’t
            get us wrong, Freddie always ate <span class='foods-highlight'>enough to keep him going,</span> but his personal assistant said that he can’t remember one time when Freddie leant back in the chair saying ‘I’m stuffed!’

          <p class='section-text'>Based on his personal assistant, as a rough guide Freddie drinks <span class='wine-highlight'>tea in the morning,
            </span> the tea was Twinings Earl Grey. He likes tea with sugars and some milk, like other Brits do. In the
            <span class='wine-highlight'>later afternoon</span>, he drinks <span class='wine-highlight'>champagne or wine</span> and with food. The champagne was usually Louis Roederer Cristal and the white wine was his favourite imported from Switzerland,
            San Saphorin. Freddie was actually quite knowledgeable about wine and he would know which one he would want with various meals with friends. In the <span class='wine-highlight'>evening,</span> he drinks <span class='wine-highlight'>vodka and tonic.</span>            His favourite vodka was Stolichnaya, but in some countries that isn’t available so he would drink Moscovskaya, really the same under a different name. Schweppes was the preferred mixer.

          <p class='section-text'>Freddie loved <span class='hot-spicy-highlight'>
            spicy food,</span> not necessarily chilli hot, but a good mix of spice. This was natural if you think back to his birthplace, Zanzibar, the spice island, and his mother would have prepared many traditional Persian dishes for him. <span class='hot-spicy-highlight'>He did like
                traditional ‘home cooking’,</span> as well as the five stars gourmet restaurants. He always used to say at home he wanted mother’s cooking. For deluxe food there were plenty of restaurants to choose from. As his illness progressed so his
            taste buds suffered and he couldn’t take strong flavours. At that time his personal chef started cooking food with much less spice and made it easy to eat food. A perfect example of that progression was with scrambled eggs. At the start the
            chef always cooked <span class='hot-spicy-highlight'>the Indian variety
                with chilli and spices,</span> that Freddie remembered from his youth, but by the last year it was served with only a small sprinkling of salt and pepper.

        <p class='section-text'>After touring Japan with Queen in 1975, Freddie’s favourite place on earth was Japan, its culture and art. He was overwhelmed by the reception Japanese audiences. If Japan is well known for their tasty traditional tasty foods, such as sushi and
          sashimi. Well, it’s not the first thing what Freddie loves about Japan. Life could be so frantic and Tokyo was always so busy, but he continually found it a place to recharge his batteries. He loves Japanese arts. He had a lovely collection
          of lacquered boxes, furniture in Japanese motifs, Japanese crockery and porcelains, and Hakata dolls.

        <p class="japan-quote">He was acknowledged once as one of persons who has the largest collections of antique Japanese wood block prints in a private collection in the UK.
